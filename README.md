# Mapreduce-Using-MRJob-

In this repository I will focus on using MRJob for performing queries on different data sets, including, transaction dataset, forum logs, internet logs, and finally some queries on Rumi poems. 
When the data set is big I will push the job onto AWS EMR. In this work I mainly focus on using different MRJob structures for performing queries on different data sets.
Sometimes, I will use matplotlib to graph the results.
